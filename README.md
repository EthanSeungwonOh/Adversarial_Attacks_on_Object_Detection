# Universal Adversarial Perturbations to Object Detection

## Description
Official implementation of the paper "Resilience of Autonomous Vehicle Object Category Detections to Universal Adversarial Perturbations".

## Adversarial Attack on Object Detection
We experimented the effect of Universal Adversarial Perturbation using Projected Gradient Descent(PGD) on object detection.

## Adversarial Defense on Object Detection
Now that we have seen the effectiveness of universal adversarial perturbations on object detection, we searched for defenses that would work best on this attack.
