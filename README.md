# Universal Adversarial Perturbations to Object Detection
This is an implementation of projected gradient descent attack to create universal adversarial perturbations on object detection described in the paper "Resilience of Autonomous Vehicle Object Category Detections to Universal Adversarial Perturbations".

## Getting Started

Clone this repository by running

    git clone https://github.com/seungwonoh5/Universal_Autonomous_Detection

You can experiment with the ReColorAdv attack, by itself and combined with other attacks, in the [`getting_started.ipynb`](getting_started.ipynb) Jupyter notebook. You can also open the notebook in Google Colab via the badge below.
